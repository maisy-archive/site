# Hi there!

I'm **Beef**, a developer from Britain. I love to build innovative new things, and I am generally a friendly person.

<div class="flex flex-row gap-2 mt-4">
    <AttributeCard icon="round-person" text="he/him" />
    <AttributeCard icon="round-school" text="Studying Computer Science" />
    <AttributeCard icon="round-translate" text="Fluent in English and learning German" />
</div>

## Programming

I mostly develop in **TypeScript** and **JavaScript**. I am versed in both frontend development as well as backend development, my preference. Building projects for fun is my passion, and you can find my work on my [GitHub](//github.com/Beefers), or on the upcoming Projects page on this site.

## Android

Another of my hobbies is modding Android phones, i.e. rooting, installing custom ROMs, and any other shenanigans related to the OS. Currently, I use a Google Pixel 5, and I have bricked it 3 times. However, I also have several older phones, most of which I have revived by installing custom software.

## Hardware

I also enjoy building PCs and modifying other hardware. Both of the PCs I use on a daily basis were hand-built by me!
